Calculate the time dilation by velocity as described by special relativity using Rust! :crab:

## Code
```rs
fn time_dilation_by_velocity(t: f64, v: f64) -> f64 {
    t / (1.0 - ((v * v) / (C * C))).sqrt()
}
```

## Units Used
```
t: time in seconds
v: km/s
```

## Constants
```rs
const C: f64 = 299_792_458.0;
```

## Equation
Here is the equation for time dilation from velocity.
