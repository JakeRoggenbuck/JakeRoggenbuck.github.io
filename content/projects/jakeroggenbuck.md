<details>
<summary>I also created a fork of OpenAI's gpt-2 at https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/gpt-2 in 2019 but didn't push any changes.
</summary>
- I still cannot believe how implactful this one project has been on the world as a whole and on software engineering especially<br>
- You can verify the creation date with GitHub's api at https://api.github.com/repos/jakeroggenbuck/gpt-2 and look at the `created_at` field
