## Usage

Navigate to a url with the parameter `event` to submit a response.

## TODO:

- [x] Create a state that is the `vibe context` (e.g. A meeting) so that it can be displayed like `vibe for today's meeting` so these responses can all get aggregated in the same place.

- [ ] Create a button to create a new page or `vibe context`, so say the GitHub OAuth user JakeRoggenbuck can create a new page called `General Meeting 1` with the random code `867976` that others can visit from the url bar

- [x] Create a backend for different pages, their questions, and a place to submit the feedback

- [ ] Create a frontend prompt when creating a new page that allows you to make multiple questions that can either be answered with stars or a comment box

## Learning
