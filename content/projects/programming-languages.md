# programming-languages
This is list of programming languages I have made for learning. In each project there were many key takeaways that can be learned from. I will continue to add information and lessons learned from each project. I will also add a description of each project and what it accomplished.

# jai [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/jai)] <- Latest
Jai is a programming language
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/jai

# plrs [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/plrs)] (Lexer library)
 The multi-tool of lexical analysis and tokenization. Make parsers in less time for many use cases. 
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/plrs

# f09f [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/f09f)]
pronounced fonf; is a simple statically typed language with simple but powerful syntax
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/f09f
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/f09f-rs

#### Description
This one was my first lexer written in C++ and was very fast and robust. This is also a project where I did the first reimplementation of a lexer for the same lang. The reimplementation was in Rust, so it was also my first lexer in Rust.

# mahou [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/mahou)]

#### Description
Mahou is my AP Computer Science create task for the 2020-21 year. Mahou is a source-to-source compiler, from a custom language to python.
Mahou uses a lexer to find all of the tokens in the original source, then uses a parser to convert the source code into python.
