# programming-languages
This is list of programming languages I have made for learning. In each project there were many key takeaways that can be learned from. I will continue to add information and lessons learned from each project. I will also add a description of each project and what it accomplished.

# Component (2024) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/component)] <- Latest
A programming language that compiles to x86-64 assembly for math using postfix notation
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/component

# Unit Language (2024) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/unit-language)]
A small programming language with postfix notation using TypeScript and Deno.

# Basis (2023) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/basis)]
A math console language with a bunch of useful functions and constants
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/basis

# jai (2021) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/jai)]
Jai is a programming language
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/jai

# plrs (2021) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/plrs)] (Lexer library)
 The multi-tool of lexical analysis and tokenization. Make parsers in less time for many use cases. 
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/plrs

# f09f (2021) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/f09f)]
pronounced fonf; is a simple statically typed language with simple but powerful syntax
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/f09f
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/f09f-rs

#### Description
This one was my first lexer written in C++ and was very fast and robust. This is also a project where I did the first reimplementation of a lexer for the same lang. The reimplementation was in Rust, so it was also my first lexer in Rust.

# mahou (2021) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/mahou)]

#### Description
Mahou is my AP Computer Science create task for the 2020-21 year. Mahou is a source-to-source compiler, from a custom language to python.
Mahou uses a lexer to find all of the tokens in the original source, then uses a parser to convert the source code into python.

# Paper (2021) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/Paper)]

- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/Paper

# Planck (2020) [[source](https://github.com/plancklang)]
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/pinter

# ice (2020) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/ice)]
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/ice

# snow_script (2020) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/snow_script)]
A simple and high/low macro lang, similar to pogscript with way nicer syntax
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/snow_script

# calcLex (2020) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/calcLex)]
A test of lexing and yacc in python
- https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/calcLex

# cruz-lang (2020) [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/cruz-lang)]
