# Dataframe Function Speed Analysis

Testing a bunch of ways to apply a function to each item in a dataframe.

# Goal

Find the optimal way to apply different types of functions to a large dataframe.

# Results

Each test has been run 5 times, timed and averaged with the functions time_function, and time_average respectively.<br>
Error bars are present, however they are very small (in the hundredths of seconds).
