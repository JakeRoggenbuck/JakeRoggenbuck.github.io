> Read the Structure section â€” We use both Rust and Python and they go in different places

## Setup
Create a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Source the virtual environment
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install maturin
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
Build the Rust code
```
maturin build --release
```

Install the module (Note: the version will change so check the exact filename in `target/wheels/`)
```
pip install target/wheels/lstore* --force-reinstall
```

Run the database benchmark
```
python3 __main__.py
```

You should see this for milestone 1.

#### lstore
The lstore (`./lstore`) directory is where the Python code goes. This is what gets called by the tests in `__main__.py`. The lstore directory can be referred to as a Python module.

#### src
The src (`./src`) directory is where the Rust code goes. This gets called by the code in the lstore module.

`system.rs` - all the functions and structs related to getting information from the system machine
`database.rs` - the database struct and the related functions

## Demo Project

In the demo project, we made an API that uses our database to store grades. Here we are sending a PUT and then doing a GET.

## Results

### Milestone 1

After a simple fix after we submitted, we were able to get everything working.

## Use in Python

This is a quickstart for how to use RedosQL as a library in Python. To follow along, run the [setup instructions](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/RedoxQL?tab=readme-ov-file#setup) and then you can write the following code.

```py
# Import the database class
from lstore.db import Database

# Create an instance of the database
db = Database()
```

```py
# Create a table in the database
# This table has 5 columns and the primary key is the 0th column
grades_table = db.create_table('Grades', 5, 0)
```

```py
# Import the query
from lstore.query import Query
```

```py
# Insert a row with the primary key 0 and 4 grades
query.insert([0, 91, 92, 93, 94])
```

```py
# Update the 1st column in the database
query.update(0, [90, None, None, None])
```

## Testing

### Rust testing

```
cargo test
```

Here is what the correct output should look like. You should see multiple tests passing.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6aee0b5-571f-4450-9381-296efc5e2f73)

#### Unit Tests

Rust unit tests are located in each Rust file and can be found in `./src`

#### Integration Tests

The integration tests are located at `./tests` and are also run with `cargo test`

### Python testing
```
pytest
```

Python tests are located in a separate directory called `tests` located in `./python`

## Rust Docs

Rust has a way of making docs from the source code. Run `cargo doc` and view the produced HTML page in your browser. Adding comments to your code starting with `///` will be put into these docs.

## Speed Analysis

### Using flamegraph to benchmark

You may need to install flamegraph with `cargo install flamegraph`

```sh
cargo flamegraph --test update_tests
```

```sh
# Open the svg (It's nice to view in a browser)
firefox flamegraph.svg
```

Preview:

### Running cargo benchmarks

This will take a long time but you can run benchmarks separately.

```sh
cargo bench
```

You can use `cargo bench` to see if your changes significantly affect performance.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/367e1f7a-dd85-46ed-998a-939f95a1b561)

Often small changes can happen randomly. Like this has no change in the code.
Try to run the bench as the only thing running on the system.

### Using maturin in release mode

Maturin is what builds our Python package. Maturin has a mode called `--release` that significantly improves the speed. This is because release mode runs Cargo in release mode, and this does all of the optimization tricks to speed up the executable as much as possible.

### Running with debug or info logging

To use the logger, import the debug, error, or info macro from the log crate.
Then you can add the macros to code like `debug!("Start database!");`.
When you go to run the code, you can set the env var `RUST_LOG=debug`.
Docs: https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/.

### We tried Pypy

We started to try using Pypy which is a runtime for Python that is supposedly faster. Because of [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law), we actually can't get all that much performance out of it. We also found that the newest version of Pypy cannot use the newest version of Pyo3, so future work is needed to get them to run together.

Future questions:
- [ ] How much time does the Python part take up?
- [x] How do we measure the improvement from Python to Pypy
- [x] How do we downgrade Pypy to work with Py03

We opted to go for C Python because it's much faster in this use case. We show the results of some tests [here](./python/py-opt/cpython-vs-pypy.md).

### Profiling Python

We use `py-spy` to profile Python and we got expected results. It shows that the main use of Python is just the update function when testM2.py is run.

Here is how we ran it:

```
py-spy record -o profile.svg -- python3 testM2.py
```

[profile](./profile.svg)

### Moving everything possible to Rust

We used to make a ReturnRecord object for every single row! We also would turn the result of rquery into a list, wrap each in ReturnRecord and then make that back into a new list. ReturnRecord would also do list truncation each time it was initialized (for each row). We moved all of this logic into Rust can simply return what the Rust function returns. This change improved the performance by nearly **30%**. The speed of testM2.py went from 1.30 seconds to 0.92 seconds. These results we consistent across 3 different runs each done in an interwoven fashion (with change, then without change, then with change again, etc.) for a total of 6 runs. The change can be seen in [PR#162](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/ecs-165a-database/pull/162).

```diff
-   class ReturnRecord:
-       def __init__(self, columns: List[int]):
-           self.columns = columns[4:]
-
-       def __str__(self):
-           return f"Record({self.columns})"

-   return [
-       ReturnRecord(
-           list(
-               self.rquery.select_version(
-                   search_key,
-                   search_key_index,
-                   projected_columns_index,
-                   relative_version,
-               )
-           )
-       )
-   ]
+   return self.rquery.select_version(
+       search_key,
+       search_key_index,
+       projected_columns_index,
+       relative_version,
+   )
```

This includes `insert` and `update`.

### Using FxHashMap instead of default HashMap

The Rust default HashMap is a great general purpose HashMap implementation and is very fast but FxHashMap is a decent bit faster.
After changing the page directory to use FxHashMap in [PR#186](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/ecs-165a-database/pull/186), the speed of many reads and writes improved by **over 28%** and the overall speed of all the benchmarks improved by **over 26%**.

```rs
use crate::container::{ReservedColumns, NUM_RESERVED_COLUMNS};
use crate::index::RIndexHandle;
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use rustc_hash::FxHashMap;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, RwLock};

type RedoxQLHasher<K, V> = FxHashMap<K, V>;

#[derive(Default, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PageDirectoryMetadata {
    pub directory: HashMap<i64, RecordMetadata>,
    pub directory: RedoxQLHasher<i64, RecordMetadata>,
}

#[derive(Default, Clone)]
pub struct PageDirectory {
    pub directory: HashMap<i64, Record>,
    pub directory: RedoxQLHasher<i64, Record>,
}
// -- snip --
```

### Using Rust compilation flags

You can set specific build flags that improve the optimization.

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = "fat"
codegen-units = 1
opt-level = 3
```

- `lto = "fat"` is the max setting for "Link time optimization", meaning that when it links the binary together, it does the maximum amount of optimizations.

- `codegen-units = 1` means that rustc will not split up the source code into different parts to compile separately on different threads. Because of this, it's able to apply optimization tricks like inlining between libraries and our project source code.

- `opt-level = 3` is just setting the optimization level. The reason you might want it lower is compilation speed.

### Using snakeviz to profile

After reading bits from the O'Reilly _High Performance Python, 3rd Edition_, I found out about profiling with snakeviz.

```
pip install snakeviz
```

```
python3 -m cProfile -o profile.prof testM2.py
```

```
snakeviz profile.prof
```

Here is the output from `testM2.py`

### Python dis library and bytecode

Python gets parsed into bytecode and we can see it using the [dis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html) library. This can be useful to see what byte might be unneeded.
