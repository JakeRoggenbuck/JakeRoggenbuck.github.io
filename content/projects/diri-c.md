# Diri-c
**DIR**ectory **I**nfo tool written in C that lets you look at a summary of a directory and which projects are using a version control system and if they are connected to a remote control system.

 ## Why?
 **because...** I have too many directories

Some of these are local git repos with github remotes, some are git repos with no remotes, and some are not using git at all.
