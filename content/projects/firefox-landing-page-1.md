# Landing Page
Clone the library to your computer

    git clone git@github.com:Camerooooon/landing-page.git

Now set the homepage of your browser to the location of the index.html file on your computer. You may need to use an extention for chrome.
Inorder to control which search engine you want to use you must use the left and right arrow keys.

This idea was inspired by JakeRoggenbuck's landing page repo.
