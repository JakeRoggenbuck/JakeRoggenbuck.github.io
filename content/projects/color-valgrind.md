# color-valgrind
Highlight important information from the already great [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)

## Why?
I often switch quickly between valgrind output and code. This leads to me lossing my place often. I also re-run valgrind many times in s short period of time, leading to me having to find what I was looking at previously to compare. All of this is a bit easier with colorful out.
