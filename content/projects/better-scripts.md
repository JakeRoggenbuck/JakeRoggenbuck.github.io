# better-scripts

Scripts that are better than [the ones](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/.scripts) I wrote a long time ago

# Docs

Docs for each script can be found it its directory.

# Install

```sh
sh ./install.sh
```

# Build

Installing will write the scripts to `build/`

# Goals

The goal with this repository is to have better documentation, readability, and functionality than the [old repository](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/.scripts).
