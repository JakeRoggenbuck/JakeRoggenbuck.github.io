# better-scripts
Scripts that are better than [the ones](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/.scripts) I wrote a long time ago

# Docs
Docs for each script can be found it its directory.

# Install
```sh
sh ./install.sh
```

# Bin
Installing will write the scripts to `bin/`

# Goals
The goal with this repository is to have better documentation, readability, and functionality than the [old repository](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/.scripts).
