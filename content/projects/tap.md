# Tap ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/jakeroggenbuck/tap/Rust?style=for-the-badge)
Quickly tap basic file into existence

## Help
```sh
# create an empty python file
tap it py

# create an empty python file with argparse boilerplate
tap it pyarg
```

## TODO
- Also have an `--output` option for making `PYTHON_ARG` into anything given as `--output`
- Add more defaults
- Add scripts like `cargo init && then copy file`
- Add name inserting from config or username
- Add year inserting for copyright or license
