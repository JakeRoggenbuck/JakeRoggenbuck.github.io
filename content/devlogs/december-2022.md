# New projects
I created a program to learn [linearization](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/linearization).

[Salt](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/salt) is another project (Symbol And Lexer Toolkit). Salt aims to lex and tokenize c source code for three reasons.
1. Make auto include suggestions for file and libraries
2. Check where every imported symbol is from and warn if imports aren't needed
3. Generate documentation of a library in a c file

# School
I spent a lot of time this month working on school projects and preparing for finals.

I try to overlap coding and my school as much as possible, so before finals I spent a few hours working on projects that reinforce my understanding in Math.

I made this diagram for [find-slope-with-secant](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/find-slope-with-secant) recently.

I also made this diagram for [newtons-method](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/newtons-method).
