## Work

I just finished a month of work at Lucid Automation. I have been working with Go using Gin-Gonic and React JS. I have also been working with Keras and Tensorflow in Python. It has been an amazing experience and I have learned tons already.

## Hackathons

In this month, I also did two hackathons, Plant Here and Future Fire Finder.

### 1. Plant Here ðŸŒ¿

The first was a project called Plant here. Its goal is to help with food insecuritis by finding the best places on a map to plant certain types of food, ones with the correct amount of rain and soil pH.

### 2. Future Fire Finder ðŸ”¥

Predict places that will likely have forest fires.
