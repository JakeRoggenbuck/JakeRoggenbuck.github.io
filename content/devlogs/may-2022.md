title: May 2022 - Da Vinci Game Jam & More Auto Clock Speed
type: page
---

This month I had my finals and AP tests, all of which where a lot of work, but I still worked on some project and organized the first annual Da Vinci Game Jam for my school. Links to the resources for the workshops can be found [here](https://jr0.org/events/dv-game-jam-2022/). The game jam was an overall success and we had many great game entries. This month I also worked on auto clock speed some more, adding a universal interface to all of the commands and other issues. I created a total of 44 commits on that project this month. Github summarizes this month with 'Created 238 commits in 26 repositories', I also created 13 repositories this month, two for the game jam, one related to a possible future [auto-clock-speed](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed) side project, two about my statistics class, two about my link shortener project, two related to JABACAT (Group of programmers), and one as a tool to help view csv files that I might release sometime next month.
