This months has been pretty interesting. I have learned several things like how to use Gatsby and GraphQL. I have been working on auto-clock-speed a lot, and I 0.1.8 was released! I have also been writing code for the Hermes project. This months I picked up the book 'Design Patterns' and it's great. Something that I have been using more often is React. Sometimes I forget how useful a good frontend framework can be. On an unrelated note, I have been learning more about computer science theory and software development history. Knowing what others did in the past is helpful when making decision.
