## HackDavis - Hackathon

[HackDavis](https://hackdavis.io/live) is a hackathon group on UC Davis campus and organizes coding events.

#### AggieWorks Presentation - Workshop

I presented a workshop with a group of other AggieWorks Product Managers about Product Management.
I specifically talked about software development practices, agile, using git collaboratively, and other high level technical product manager topics and advice.

#### My hackdavis project

I didn't have much time to write my project so I allocated an hour to work on it. My project slogan is `Send a positive message to an Aggie! Simple can be powerful. It takes no effort to share kindness.`. I am very proud of the idea here and I really liked experimenting with the OpenAI API to moderate messages.

## Projects

#### sxbsbamdws

The backlight brightness changing has not been working on my Arch Linux laptop and no tools could change the brightness, so I built my own tool. I have it the over-the-top acronym [sxbsbamdws](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/sxbsbamdws).

#### OpenAI projects

So far, I have just experimented with the API to see how it can be used in the future. These are a lot of great tools to use here. I am very impressed. I remember using GPT2 when it came out on github in 2019 and running the docker for some text completion. It has come a long long way. I currently haven't released any open source projects that include the use of the API but those are soon to be released.
