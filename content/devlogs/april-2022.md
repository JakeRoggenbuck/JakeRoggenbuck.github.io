title: April 2022 - Local List Business Pitch
type: page
---

On April 21st, the whole Local List team (Me and 4 others) got to present our business to our town's chamber of commerce. Our idea and demo was met with lots of excitement and great feedback. The day after, we got to pitch our idea to more business owners during our school's business project's night event. We won the event's Judges award for our idea and presentation. The current site can be found at [thelocallist.org]("http://thelocallist.org"). Our judges invited us to a city event where we will have a booth and present to the public. This month, I also made two projects ([derive]("https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/derive"), and [integrate]("https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/integrate")) in C that implement ideas from calculus. I also started using Svelte for a mindfulness tracker app that I might publish in a few weeks.
