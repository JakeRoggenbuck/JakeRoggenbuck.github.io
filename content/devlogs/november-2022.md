This month, I did 191 commits in 37 repos. I also opened 31 pull requests.

### Research
I started a new paper that will be added to [research](/research) when it's done.

### Tap
I worked on my program called Tap. This tool helps you quickly tap basic files into existence. Similar to snippets, tap generates full boiler plate files like simple make files, python with argparse setup, etc.

### Flamegraph

I started using flamegraph for [auto-clock-speed](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed)

Here is an example from [Optimize read_lid_state function call #465](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed/issues/465)
