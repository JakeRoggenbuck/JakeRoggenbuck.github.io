This month, I registered the domains finditlocal.org and finditlocal.us for a company called Local List I started in connection with my Econ class. I created a frontend using React and a backend using Django. Currently, both are hosted and communicating to display local products at those domains. I am really excited for this project and I even printed business cards and stickers for the project to share with classmates. I feel like this project is the latest culmination of my skills in frontend, backend, and system architecture. The part I am most proud of is the architecture and design decisions to allow for further development and higher traffic as the project grows. I also worked more on my yet to be released (as of March 31st 2022) runtime-analysis-paper, including a new idea I thought of regarding error handling.
