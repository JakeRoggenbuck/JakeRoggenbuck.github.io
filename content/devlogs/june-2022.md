title: June 2022 - Go, C, and Rust!
type: page
---

This month I have committed to keeping up three system languages (Go, Rust, C) to learn more about backend tools and system programs. I also keep up my skills with Python because it is a great language to know. I made a library called Sense and wrote it in [Go](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/gosense), [Rust](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/sense-rs), [C](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/sense-c), and [Python](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/sense-py). I also wrote a preprocesor for Go in Go called [Macaroon](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/macaroon). I also wrote a study tool called [study-cli](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/study-cli) in Go as well. I also continued to work on [auto-clock-speed](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed), with 1.0 on its way.
