# T3 research
I finished the first draft of my collaborative paper, titled *Observations on Every Third Digit of the Thue-Morse Sequence*.
It is still waiting peer review, but all of the content is finished.


### Abstract
We investigate some interesting properties of the sequence made up of every third term of the Thue-Morse sequence, and consider other similar sequences.

The paper can be found at [jr0.org/research/t3](https://jr0.org/research/t3).

### Follow up paper
The same people involved in t3 will continue to work on a follow up paper that takes a similar problems into consideration.
This paper will likely be published in 4 or 5 months.

# Auto Clock Speed
This month, I fixed 7 issues in [auto clock speed](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed)

# Starting college
This month, I started my freshman year at UC Davis.
I am taking a Math class, CS class, and a Philosophy class.

In the CS class, we will be using C, so I will probably do a lot of personal projects in C for the next few months.

One of those such projects is [jimbot](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/jimbot) - a discord bot written in C.

I will keep doing what is now undergraduate research in the areas of mathematics, computer science, and computational biology.
