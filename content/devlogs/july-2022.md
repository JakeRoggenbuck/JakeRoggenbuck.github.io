This month, I made 231 commits in 30 different repositories. One of my favorite projects was [BestNextStep](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/BestNextStep) which was a project that I thought of many years ago but was not able to fully develop until the last few years. I have also been working on a math paper with the current (tentative to change) title of *Observations of Every Third Digit of the Thue-Morse Sequence*. This month I created 11 repositories, two are cli applications in Go. They are [timely](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/timely) for keeping track of hours for work and [port-checker](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/port-checker) for checking open ports on a machine. Some things that I have been testing is Svelte, Graphql, gin-gonic. I will be starting work on August first as a Software Developer and I am very excited.
