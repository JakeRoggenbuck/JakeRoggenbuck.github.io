## Introduction

I had the crazy idea of attaching a vintage Exakta lens to my modern Sony a6400.

I first wanted to see how I could non-permanently yet securely attach something to the body of my camera. I figured there must be some sort of camera body cover, and sure enough I found a two pack on Amazon for $7. Sweet!

Before starting, I wanted to figure out spacing of the lens. I held the lens up to the camera without attaching it, and I found that the lens needed to be a centimeter or two away from the camera body. This meant I would need to make a spacer somehow.

With the camera body cover delivered, I got to work.

### 1. Cut a circle spacer out of wood

I used a jigsaw to cut a circle out some scrap pine wood to act as a spacer.

The circle was drawn using the camera body cover as a template.

### 2. Find the center

I found the center of the circle by drawing many lines.

### 3. Drill out a hole to let light through

I drilled a hole in the spacer with a 1.5 inch paddle bit...

And snap! It broke.

### 4. Drill a hole in the scrap wood first

I learned from my mistake and started by drilling a 1.5 inch hole with the same bit in the scrap wood first.

I first found the center the same way.

And then I drilled the hole.

### 5. Cut out the spacer

I cut out the spacer with the hole already drilled.

I also sanded down the spacer with two grits of sandpaper.

### 6. Glue the space to the lens

I used hot glue to glue the spacer to the lens of the Exakta.

### 7. Find the center of the cover

I found the center of the camera body cover using the many lines trick.

### 8. Drill a pilot hole

I drilled a pilot hole with a small bit to make the centering of the paddle bit easier.

### 9. Drill a hole with a 1 inch paddle bit

I drilled a hole in the camera body cover with a 1 inch paddle bit to allow light through.

<img src="../../images/img_2395_720.jpg.avif" height="720">

And sanded down the edges with two different grits of sandpaper.

I also washed the piece in the sink and dried it off with a towel.

### 10. I glued the cover to the spacer

I used hot glue to attach the spacer to the camera body cover to complete the build.
