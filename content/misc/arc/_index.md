I noticed that [old.ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt](https://old.ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt) and [ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt](https://ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt) no longer redirected to the Arc Tutorial. It is however available [on the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20160305032215/http://old.ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt) and hosted on this site under [tut.txt](./tut.txt).

Arc's homepage can be found on [Paul Graham's website](https://paulgraham.com/arc.html).
