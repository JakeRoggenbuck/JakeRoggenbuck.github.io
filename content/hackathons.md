## Overview

I've participated in 14 hackathons and have won prizes ranging from $5K in free credits to a Vintage Nintendo Game Boy. More importantly, are the ad hoc teams that were built in the processing of creating projects. Hackathons are excellent for finding people you like to work with, and learning new technologies.

Vibe Gen creates great math explanation videos by creating [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) code that gets rendered into graphics.

## Hack Davis 2025 - Best Interdisciplinary Hack - Assemblr

We build acustom IDE that lowers the barrier to learning assembly to help you learn by automating an RC car.

Learning low-level programming languages like assembly is often intimidating and abstract, with a steep learning curve that students typically face later in their college years. But we believe that understanding assembly builds stronger, more powerful coders- and that it shouldn't be reserved for the few who make it that far.

We set out to democratize the learning experience by creating an interactive and engaging way to explore assembly through something tangible: controlling the movement of a RC car.

## Tranpose Platform's VibeCode Hackathon - Onlook Challenge - Chomp

We built a short-form content app for buying take-out food with the goal of reducing user dropoff from analysis paralysis.

## ProdCon 2025 - 3rd Place Winner - Sid

The core issue we are solving is that the education technology is set up for logistics and not learning, which leaves students to cram for tests, accumulate study dept, and ultimately fall behind.

Shouldn't EdTech work for students and professors?

## Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) Global Hackathon

Thousands of years ago, humans learned how to farm and formed small agricultural communities that would eventually become the complex networks of farms, food processors, and vendors that feed the world today. But humans then had no technology to assist them besides simple tools and knowledge of common patterns (such as the right weather and soil). Today we have fast internet, machine learning algorithms, and satellite technology that helps us make those decisions! We wanted to employ some of these incredible innovations to build our own service that helps farmers make the most of their land by planting the most suitable crops possible, thus contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals of zero hunger and climate action.
