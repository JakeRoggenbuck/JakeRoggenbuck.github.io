### Database Systems:

One of my many interests includes creating database systems. My prior fascination with optimization was ignited when I took [ECS 165A](https://expolab.org/ecs165a-winter2025.html) at UC Davis. My team's database called [RedoxQL](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/RedoxQL) placed first for one of the milestones based on performance. The technical write-up in the [README](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/RedoxQL) explains how we eked out every bit of performance we could using flamegraps, benchmarks, compiler settings, and performant data structures (Like B-Trees).

Since then, I've created [Kronicler](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/kronicler) which allows you to efficiently capture performance metrics for product systems. I created my own database to insure it would be fast based on problem-specific constraints like logs being append only, making my database extremely fast for this specific use case. You can start using Kronicler at [usekronicler.com](usekronicler.com) for performance metrics, or you could use the fast database implementation for similar problems by importing the library and manually capturing data as explained in the [README](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/kronicler).
