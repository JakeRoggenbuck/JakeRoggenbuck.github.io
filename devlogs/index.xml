Our idea and demo was met with lots of excitement and great feedback. The day after, we got to pitch our idea to more business owners during our school&amp;rsquo;s business project&amp;rsquo;s night event. We won the event&amp;rsquo;s Judges award for our idea and presentation.

I am currently taking an Assembly class, Discrete math, Calculus, and another student lead CS course about linux. These classes have been super helpful and fun and I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot!
My favorite topic in my Assembly class is implementing algorithms with bitwise operations.
My favorite part of Discrete math is set theory and number theory. I also really like proofs. I foresee proof writing being really helpful for math research in the future.</description></item><item><title>August 2022</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/august-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/august-2022/</guid><description>Work I just finished a month of work at Lucid Automation. I have been working with Go using Gin-Gonic and React JS. I have also been working with Keras and Tensorflow in Python. It has been an amazing experience and I have learned tons already.
Hackathons In this month, I also did two hackathons, Plant Here and Future Fire Finder.
1. Plant Here ðŸŒ¿ The first was a project called Plant here.</description></item><item><title>December 2022</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/december-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/december-2022/</guid><description>New projects I created a program to learn linearization.
Salt is another project (Symbol And Lexer Toolkit). Salt aims to lex and tokenize c source code for three reasons.
Make auto include suggestions for file and libraries Check where every imported symbol is from and warn if imports aren&amp;rsquo;t needed Generate documentation of a library in a c file School I spent a lot of time this month working on school projects and preparing for finals.</description></item><item><title>February 2022 - Creating Dev Log Page</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/february-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/february-2022/</guid><description>This months has been pretty interesting. I have learned several things like how to use Gatsby and GraphQL. I have been working on auto-clock-speed a lot, and I 0.1.8 was released! I have also been writing code for the Hermes project. This months I picked up the book &amp;lsquo;Design Patterns&amp;rsquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s great. Something that I have been using more often is React. Sometimes I forget how useful a good frontend framework can be.</description></item><item><title>Febuary 2023</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/february-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/february-2023/</guid><description>This month I was working a lot on school and clubs I am associated with so I didnâ€™t have a bunch of time to work on personal projects, but I do have some highlights to share.

I spent a lot of time working on AggieWorks and School. I didnâ€™t do as much for personal projects but I still have some interesting things to share for this month.
I started implementing different data structures in C. Then I started incorporating these into a handful of projects.

One of my favorite projects was BestNextStep which was a project that I thought of many years ago but was not able to fully develop until the last few years. I have also been working on a math paper with the current (tentative to change) title of Observations of Every Third Digit of the Thue-Morse Sequence. This month I created 11 repositories, two are cli applications in Go.</description></item><item><title>June 2022 - Go, C, and Rust!</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/june-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/june-2022/</guid><description>This month I have committed to keeping up three system languages (Go, Rust, C) to learn more about backend tools and system programs. I also keep up my skills with Python because it is a great language to know. I made a library called Sense and wrote it in Go, Rust, C, and Python. I also wrote a preprocesor for Go in Go called Macaroon. I also wrote a study tool called study-cli in Go as well.</description></item><item><title>March 2022 - Starting Local List</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/march-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/march-2022/</guid><description>This month, I registered the domains finditlocal.org and finditlocal.us for a company called Local List I started in connection with my Econ class. I created a frontend using React and a backend using Django. Currently, both are hosted and communicating to display local products at those domains. I am really excited for this project and I even printed business cards and stickers for the project to share with classmates. I feel like this project is the latest culmination of my skills in frontend, backend, and system architecture.</description></item><item><title>March 2023</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/march-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/march-2023/</guid><description>Coming Soon - Devious Code Contest I started the website for the soon to come Devious Code Contest found at deviouscc.org. This contest will happen sometime in the next year. The problems have been chosen and written but other details are still being decided.
satellite-c - Practice for writing satellite subsystems in C [link] This was a super interesting project that is still in development. I join a club called Space and Satellite Systems and we will be writing code for a satellite in C.</description></item><item><title>May 2022 - Da Vinci Game Jam &amp; More Auto Clock Speed</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/may-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/may-2022/</guid><description>This month I had my finals and AP tests, all of which where a lot of work, but I still worked on some project and organized the first annual Da Vinci Game Jam for my school. Links to the resources for the workshops can be found here. The game jam was an overall success and we had many great game entries. This month I also worked on auto clock speed some more, adding a universal interface to all of the commands and other issues.</description></item><item><title>May 2023</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/may-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/may-2023/</guid><description>HackDavis - Hackathon HackDavis is a hackathon group on UC Davis campus and organizes coding events.
AggieWorks Presentation - Workshop I presented a workshop with a group of other AggieWorks Product Managers about Product Management. I specifically talked about software development practices, agile, using git collaboratively, and other high level technical product manager topics and advice.
My hackdavis project I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to write my project so I allocated an hour to work on it.</description></item><item><title>November 2022</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/november-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/november-2022/</guid><description>This month, I did 191 commits in 37 repos. I also opened 31 pull requests.
Research I started a new paper that will be added to research when it&amp;rsquo;s done.
Tap I worked on my program called Tap. This tool helps you quickly tap basic files into existence. Similar to snippets, tap generates full boiler plate files like simple make files, python with argparse setup, etc.
Flamegraph I started using flamegraph for auto-clock-speed</description></item><item><title>October 2022</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/october-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/october-2022/</guid><description>Update In October I did 146 commits and created 9 repositories. I have been using C a lot this months because my class I am currently taking is in C. This has inspired me to write a lot of my new side projects in C. At least the ones where C makes sense as a language.
This month, I made an October themed fetch program. JakeRoggenbuck/spookyfetch
Auto Clock Speed 0.1.10 In this release, we closed and completed 76 issues.</description></item><item><title>September 2022</title><link>https://jr0.org/devlogs/september-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jr0.org/devlogs/september-2022/</guid><description>T3 research I finished the first draft of my collaborative paper, titled Observations on Every Third Digit of the Thue-Morse Sequence. It is still waiting peer review, but all of the content is finished.
Abstract We investigate some interesting properties of the sequence made up of every third term of the Thue-Morse sequence, and consider other similar sequences.
The paper can be found at jr0.org/research/t3.
Follow up paper The same people involved in t3 will continue to work on a follow up paper that takes a similar problems into consideration.</description></item></channel></rss>
